Recently, I've been playing around and, after a research of a problem, I've found that there is constant EMEDIUMTYPE defined in errno.h, with comment "Wrong medium type". Googled and haven't found a good explanation of what that actually means. I've encountered the term while programming a server using OpenSSL (this I'm writing just to provide some context) but not directly.

So, what does EMEDIUMTYPE mean in general and in this context (if there is any difference, of course)?
